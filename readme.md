Diabetes Prediction Web App (Ideathon 2025)
Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not. The model uses the Random Forest algorithm, optimized with Jades Algorithm, and generates a doctor's report in PDF format.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Random Forest

Optimization Algorithm: Jades Algorithm

End Product: Web-based application

Report Generation: PDF output for doctor's review

Prediction Output: "Diabetes" or "No Diabetes"
